#Professional Portfolio

##Description
The purpose of this project was to create a website that could showcase my skills as a developer. The website is a portfolio of all my work that I will be able to add to throughout my course and my career. 

The primary goals of this project are:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

This project will be instrumental in helping me secure a job in the field. 

##Usage
the project hosted at:

https://github.com/goodwinamundson/professional_portfolio 

can be accessed with the link: 

https://goodwinamundson.github.io/Professional_Portfolio 

The second link brings you to the live page.

All the links on the website worked when I tested them. The website should appear as it does in the following screenshots:

Even though I know this assignment was pretty sloppy so far, I am going to go back and fix everything in the coming days. I know that doing well on this assignment benefits me a lot more outside of this course.

I used some w3schools.com and github.com as guides as well as using some code from my other projects on my github profile.
